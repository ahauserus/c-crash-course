Pointer Arithmetic
- These are operations that are performed on the memory locations of variables.
- Pointers are used to access memory locations of variables.
- There are limited set of pointer arithmetic operations.
	1. Incremented ( ++ )
	2. Decremented ( -- )
	3. Inter addition ( + or += )
	4. Inter subtraction ( - or -= )


Working of Pointer Arithmetic	Operations
1. Incremented ( ++ )
	Example:
	array[5] = {25, 67, 13, 12, 10}

	int *ptr = &array[5];
	ptr++; -> This means that ptr will point to the next element of array, array[1] = 67;

Poiter to a pointer
- When a pointer holds the address of another pointer, it is a poointer to a pointer.
- It is alos known as a double pointer.
	- Eg:
		int *ptr2 = *ptr1 = &array[5];
		ptr2 is a double pointer that points to the address of ptr1.

		A double pointer has 2 basic meanings:
		- A pointer to a pointer.
			Changing the value of a double pointer changes the original pointer.
		- 2-d array such a matrix of a list of char*. A single pointer is a 1-d array.
			A double pointer is a 2-d array. This can also be said to be a list of character pointers (list of char*)
		- Example of a 2d array is: char* argv[]


Declaring a Double Pointer:
	Syntax:
		DataType **VariableName;
		- int i = 5;
		int *ptr1;
		int **ptr2;

	Expounding:
		ptr1 = &i; -> ptr1 holds the address of i.
		ptr2 = &ptr1; -> ptr2 holds the address of ptr1.


Side Note.
	- Call by reference is also called call by arguments.
	- There is also a call by value.

	- In call by value, the the actual parameter value will be substituted with formal parameters.
	- Whatever changes done to the formal parameters will not reflect the actual parameters.
	- Values are not changed in call by value.
	- This concept uses pointers.

Void Pointers
- Void pointers are used to point to a memory location that does not hold any value.
- Void pointers are also known as null pointers.
- They are not associated with any data type.
- They are used to store addresses of any data type.

In C, malloc() and calloc() functions return void * pointers. The twp are used for dynamic memory allocation.
They are used in situations where we are bnot sure about the adrress of the data type.


NULL Pointer
- NULL is a constant in C. It's value is 0.
- In case with the pointer - if any pointer does not conatin a valid memory address or any pointer is uninitialized, we refer to that as a "NULL" pointer.
- We can alos assign 0 or NULL to make a pointer null.
