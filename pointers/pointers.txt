Pointer Arithmetic
- These are operations that are performed on the memory locations of variables.
- Pointers are used to access memory locations of variables.
- There are limited set of pointer arithmetic operations.
	1. Incremented ( ++ )
	2. Decremented ( -- )
	3. Inter addition ( + or += )
	4. Inter subtraction ( - or -= )


Working of Pointer Arithmetic	Operations
1. Incremented ( ++ )
	Example:
	array[5] = {25, 67, 13, 12, 10}

	int *ptr = &array[5];
	ptr++; -> This means that ptr will point to the next element of array, array[1] = 67;
